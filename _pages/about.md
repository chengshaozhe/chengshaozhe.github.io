About Me
======
Hi! I am a cognitive scientist using interdisciplinary approaches (philosophy, experimental psychology, computational models) to study both humans (children and adults) and artificial intelligence. I am interested in the unique minds that underlie human rationality and aim to explore the nature and origins of human intentional actions and **agency**. My current focus is on the social, cognitive, and computational mechanisms of human **intention** and **commitment** in the context of decision-making involving conflicting goals.

I'm currently a postdoc collaborating with computational cognitive scientist [Tao Gao](https://taogao.comm.ucla.edu/home.html) at UCLA and with developmental psychologists [Tamar Kushnir](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/TAMAR.KUSHNIR) and [Michael Tomasello](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/michael.tomasello) at Duke University.

Cheng, S., Zhao, M., Tang, N., Zhao, Y., Zhou J., Shen, M., & Gao T. (2023). **Intention beyond desire: Spontaneous intentional commitment regulates conflicting desires**. *Cognition*, 238, 105513. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105513> [[PDF](/files/ChengEtAl_Cognition23_Intention-beyond-desire-Spontaneous-intentional-commitment-regulates-conflicting-desires.pdf)]
**<br />**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper establishes the phenomenon of intentional commitment and discusses the social-cognitive mechanisms underlying it.

Cheng, S., Zhu, J., Zhou J., Shen, M., & Gao T. (2025). **Spontaneous Coordination with Self-Commitment: How the Presence of Others Alters the Strength, Goal and Timing of Commitment**. *Cognition*. [[preprint-version](/files/ChengEtAl25-cognition-Accepted.pdf)]
**<br />**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper explores a social origin of spontaneous intentional commitment. We propose a "social inner eye" hypothesis, assuming commitment in individual decision-making arises from an internalized self-presentation, transferring the audience of commitment from a real partner to an inner eye perspective. We demonstrate how social context influences the strength, content, and timing of individual commitment.

<br /> <sup>#</sup> joint first author

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper explores the developmental origins of intentional commitment and the cognitive mechanisms underlying it.

**<br />**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper proposes a computational model of intention based on the internalized theory of mind hypothesis.

**<br />**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ongoing project examines two functional hypotheses of intentional commitment: the computational constraint hypothesis and the social origin hypothesis. (An earlier version: [PDF](/files/RSS22Workshop_IntentionalCommitment_final.pdf))
