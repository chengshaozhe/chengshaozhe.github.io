About me
======

Welcome! I am interested in the unique nature of the human mind that underlies human rationality and intelligence. Drawing insights and methods from philosophy, psychology (cognitive, developmental, and social), and artificial intelligence, I explore the social-cognitive mechanisms as well as the origins of human intentional actions and agency.
