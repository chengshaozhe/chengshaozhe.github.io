About Me
======
Hi! I am a cognitive scientist using interdisciplinary approaches (philosophy, experimental psychology, computational models) to study both humans (children and adults) and artificial intelligence. I am interested in the unique minds that underlie human rationality and aim to explore the nature and origins of human intentional actions and **agency**. My current focus is on the social-cognitive mechanisms of **intention** and **commitment**.

I'm currently working as a joint-appointed postdoc in a computational cognitive science lab at UCLA ([Visual Intelligence Lab](https://taogao.comm.ucla.edu/home.html), PI: Dr. Tao Gao) and a developmental psychology lab at Duke University ([Early Childhood Cognition Lab](https://ecclabduke.com/the-team-3), PI: Dr. Tamar Kushnir).

My most current project explores collaborative decision-making in children to create better artificial social agents.

(2023). **Intention beyond desire: Spontaneous intentional commitment regulates conflicting desires**. *Cognition*, 238, 105513. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105513> [[PDF](/files/ChengEtAl_Cognition23_Intention-beyond-desire-Spontaneous-intentional-commitment-regulates-conflicting-desires.pdf)]
**<br />**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper establishes the phenomenon of intentional commitment and discusses the social-cognitive mechanisms underlying it.

**<br />**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper explores a social origin of spontaneous intentional commitment. We propose a "social inner eye" hypothesis, assuming commitment in individual decision-making arises from an internalized self-presentation, transferring the audience of commitment from a real partner to an inner eye perspective. We demonstrate how social context influences the strength, content, and timing of individual commitment.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper proposes a computational model of intention based on the internalized theory of mind hypothesis.
